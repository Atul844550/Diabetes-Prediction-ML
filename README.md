Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes in individuals based on key medical diagnostic features. The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is used, which contains health-related attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, and more. The target variable, "Outcome", indicates whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0). The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict diabetes risk, helping in early diagnosis and timely medical intervention.

Data Preprocessing and Exploration
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and the first few rows are inspected to understand its structure.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A heatmap is generated using Seaborn to analyze feature correlations, helping identify the most influential factors for diabetes prediction.

Summary statistics are checked to detect missing values or inconsistencies in the data.

Feature Scaling:

Since different features have varying ranges, StandardScaler is used to standardize the data.

This ensures that all features contribute equally to model training, improving performance.

Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split from Scikit-Learn to evaluate model performance effectively.

Model Selection and Training
The project implements a Logistic Regression model, a widely used algorithm for binary classification problems like diabetes prediction.

Model Training:

The model is trained on the training dataset using Scikit-Learnâ€™s LogisticRegression() class.

Prediction:

Predictions are made for both training and testing datasets.

Performance Evaluation:

Model accuracy is calculated using accuracy_score from Scikit-Learn.

A confusion matrix is generated and visualized using Seaborn to analyze prediction errors, false positives, and false negatives.

A bar chart is created to compare training and testing accuracy, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Model Deployment
Saving the Model:

The trained Logistic Regression model is saved using Pickle (model.pkl), making it reusable for future predictions.

The StandardScaler object is saved using Joblib (scalar.pkl) to ensure consistent data preprocessing when making new predictions.

Deployment Readiness:

The saved model can be integrated into a web to provide real-time diabetes risk predictions.
